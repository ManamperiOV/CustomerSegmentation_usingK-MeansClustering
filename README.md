Description:
 - This project applies K-Means Clustering to segment a dataset of customer transactions, helping businesses target their marketing efforts more effectively. Key features include:
 - K-Means clustering for unsupervised segmentation.
 - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn) to understand key customer features.
 - Visualizing clusters with 2D and 3D scatter plots to understand customer groups.

Key Skills Learned:
 - Unsupervised learning (K-Means Clustering).
 - Feature engineering and preprocessing.
 - Data visualization for cluster insights.
 - Working with real-world business data for decision-making.
 - Technologies: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-Learn
